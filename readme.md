  - Determine (M:M) relationships, etc.
- Add random quote functionality (display a set, customizable number of text strings such as inspirational quotes, pertinent facts, etc.)
- UI design (CSS, etc.)


### To-do Longterm
- Mobile version (start with Kotlin or Swift, then take on the other when there's time)
